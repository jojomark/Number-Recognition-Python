# Number-Recognition-Python
This is number recognition app that can identify a number with no cap on its length, as long as the digits are clear and visible.


The app uses a CNN network implemented in Keras for digit recognition, OpenCV for image proccesing and digit seperation, and Tkinter and Pillow for a simple yet effective UI.
